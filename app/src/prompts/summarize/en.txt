Your task is to:

2. Within that category, select **3 most relevant subcategories** that best match the content of the text.
3. Provide a concise summary of the article, retaining only the key facts, important statements, and meaningful actions. Preserve political and emotional context. Be brief but informative.
4. Evaluate the **importance** of the news on the following scale:
   - 0 — the news does not affect a broad audience
   - 1 — the news may be relevant to a significant group of people
   - 2 — the news directly impacts a large audience or holds public importance
5. Extract a list of **companies** mentioned in the text.
6. Extract a list of **locations, countries, or cities** mentioned in the text.
7. Extract a list of **people's names** mentioned in the text.

  "category": "category",
  "subcategories": ["subcategory1", "subcategory2", "subcategory3"],
  "importance": 0,
  "summary": "Concise and meaningful summary of the article.",
  "companies": ["company1", "company2"],
  "locations": ["place1", "place2"],
